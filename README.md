A serise of basic tools and exploits created to best explore web application attacks.

## Techincal Description
This is a serise of scripts to help study for, and pass the OSWE exam by Offensive Security. It contains a serise of tools and exploits
created in python to exploit web application vulnerabilities. Potential items in this repository are python tools for interacting with websites
or python exploits that directly result in RCE. The tools in this repository should help with enumeration during whitebox testing as well as exploitation.

### About the OSWE
The OSWE is made for those who want to better secure, or test the security of there web applications.
People who finish the course should be able to do the following:
* Perform a deep analysis on decompiled web app source code
* Identify logical vulnerabilities that many enterprise scanners are unable to detect
* Combine logical vulnerabilities to create a proof of concept on a web app
* Exploit vulnerabilities by chaining them into complex attacks

For more information about the course please see the website [here](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/). Prerequesits include:
* Comfort reading and writing at least one coding language
* Familiarity with Linux
* Ability to write simple Python / Perl / PHP / Bash scripts
* Experience with web proxies
